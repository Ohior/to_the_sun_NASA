# To the Sun NASA
This is an android application that act as a documentation for parker solar probe
exploration to the sun

## About this app
My challenge is to develop a creative way to tell young audiences the inspiring story of Parkerâ€™s 
record-breaking journey from Earth to the Sun and all the perils it overcame on the way.
So this app act as a documentary to explain with video and pictorial documentation

## How the app works
When the app is launched, you are greeted with the NASA picture of the day. This updates everyday
because it gets it details from the NASA Api.
In the navigation drawer there are two item, Image Documentation and Video Documentation.

### Image documentation
This shows a list is images and a short popup that explains what is going on in the image

### Video documentation
This shows video on every page reload and and a brief text documentation to better explain the 
what is going on in the video
