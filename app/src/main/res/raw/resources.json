The card was installed on a plaque which was placed on the spacecraft on May 18, 2018, at Astrotech Space Operations in Titusville, Florida. The plaque dedicated the mission to Eugene Parker, who first theorized the existence of the solar wind. Parker Solar Probe is the first NASA mission to be named for a living person.",

The prominent dark feature in the center of the image is Aphrodite Terra, the largest highland region on the Venusian surface. Bright streaks in WISPR, such as the ones seen here, are typically caused by a combination of charged particles — called cosmic rays — sunlight reflected by grains of space dust, and particles of material expelled from the spacecraft’s structures after impact with those dust grains. The number of streaks varies along the orbit or when the spacecraft is traveling at different speeds, and scientists are still in discussion about the specific origins of the streaks here. The dark spot appearing on the lower portion of Venus is an artifact from the WISPR instrument.. . ",

Among the findings are new understandings of how the Sun's constant outflow of material, the solar wind, behaves.  Seen near Earth — where it can interact with our planet's natural magnetic field and cause space weather effects that interfere with technology — the solar wind appears to be a relatively uniform flow of plasma.  But Parker Solar Probe's observations reveal a complicated, active system not seen from Earth. ",

      "description": "At about 10:28 p. m.  EST on Nov.  5, Parker Solar Probe will achieve its first perihelion - its first close approach to the Sun - and will come within 15 million miles of the Sun's surface.  During perihelion, the spacecraft will reach a top speed of 213,200 miles per hour relative to the Sun. This speed and distance will mark new records for both closest solar approach and top heliocentric speed by a spacecraft. At perihelion, Parker Solar Probe will fly through material at about 3. 6 million degrees Fahrenheit.  The spacecraft will be protected from intense solar radiation by its Thermal Protection System, or heat shield.  Parker Solar Probe employs a host of autonomous systems to keep the spacecraft safe without guidance from Earth — including automatic retraction of the solar panels to regulate their temperature, attitude control using solar limb sensors that ensures all of the instruments remain in the heat shield's shadow, and a sophisticated guidance and control system that keeps the spacecraft pointed correctly. For several days around the Nov.  5 perihelion, Parker Solar Probe will be completely out of contact with Earth because of interference from the Sun's overwhelming radio emissions. Following perihelion, the mission operations team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory will await a beacon tone from the spacecraft, which will let them know the status of Parker Solar Probe.

      "title": "It's Surprisingly Hard to Go to the Sun",
      "description": "The Sun contains 99. 8 percent of the mass in our solar system.  Its gravitational pull is what keeps everything here, from tiny Mercury to the gas giants to the Oort Cloud, 186 billion miles away.  But even though the Sun has such a powerful pull, it's surprisingly hard to actually go to the Sun: It takes 55 times more energy to go to the Sun than it does to go to Mars. Why is it so difficult? The answer lies in the same fact that keeps Earth from plunging into the Sun: Our planet is traveling very fast — about 67,000 miles per hour — almost entirely sideways relative to the Sun.  The only way to get to the Sun is to cancel that sideways motion. Since Parker Solar Probe will skim through the Sun's atmosphere, it only needs to drop 53,000 miles per hour of sideways motion to reach its destination, but that's no easy feat.  In addition to using a powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy, Parker Solar Probe will perform seven Venus gravity assists over its seven-year mission to shed sideways speed into Venus' well of orbital energy.  These gravity assists will draw Parker Solar Probe's orbit closer to the Sun for a record approach of just 3. 83 million miles from the Sun's visible surface on the final orbits. Though it's shedding sideways speed to get closer to the Sun, Parker Solar Probe will pick up overall speed, bolstered by Sun's extreme gravity — so it will also break the record for the fastest-ever human-made objects, clocking in at 430,000 miles per hour on its final or",

      "title": "Discovering the Sun’s Mysteriously Hot Atmosphere",
      "description": "Something mysterious is going on at the Sun.  In defiance of all logic, its atmosphere gets much, much hotter the farther it stretches from the Sun’s blazing surface. Temperatures in the corona — the tenuous, outermost layer of the solar atmosphere — spike upwards of 2 million degrees Fahrenheit, while just 1,000 miles below, the underlying surface simmers at a balmy 10,000 F.  How the Sun manages this feat remains one of the greatest unanswered questions in astrophysics; scientists call it the coronal heating problem.  A new, landmark mission, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe — scheduled to launch no earlier than Aug.  11, 2018 — will fly through the corona itself, seeking clues to its behavior and offering the chance for scientists to solve this mystery. From Earth, as we see it in visible light, the Sun’s appearance — quiet, unchanging — belies the life and drama of our nearest star.  Its turbulent surface is rocked by eruptions and intense bursts of radiation, which hurl solar material at incredible speeds to every corner of the solar system.  This solar activity can trigger space weather events that have the potential to disrupt radio communications, harm satellites and astronauts, and at their most severe, interfere with power grids. Above the surface, the corona extends for millions of miles and roils with plasma, gases superheated so much that they separate into an electric flow of ions and free electrons.  Eventually, it continues outward as the solar wind, a supersonic stream of plasma permeating the entire solar system.  And so, it is that humans live well within the extended atmosphere of our Sun.  To fully understand the corona and all its secrets is to understand not only the star that powers life on Earth, but also, the very space around us. ",

In order to unlock the mysteries of the corona, but also to protect a society that is increasingly dependent on technology from the threats of space weather, we will send Parker Solar Probe to touch the Sun. In 2017, the mission was renamed for Eugene Parker, the S.  Chandrasekhar Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago.  In the 1950s, Parker proposed a number of concepts about how stars—including our Sun—give off energy.  He called this cascade of energy the solar wind, and he described an entire complex system of plasmas, magnetic fields, and energetic particles that make up this phenomenon.  Parker also theorized an explanation for the superheated solar atmosphere, the corona, which is – contrary to what was expected by physics laws -- hotter than the surface of the sun itself.  This is the first NASA mission that has been named for a living individual. ",

The chamber – officially called the Space Environment Simulator – creates a nearly identical replication of the conditions the spacecraft will face during its mission to the Sun. After the air was slowly removed from the chamber over the course of five hours, cooling tubes behind the chamber walls were chilled to -320 degrees Fahrenheit (-196 Celsius). Engineers will cycle the chamber’s temperatures from hot to cold to ensure Parker Solar Probe will be prepared for operations around the Sun.  During this cycling, the spacecraft’s systems will undergo testing that mimics critical events that occur during its planned seven-year mission in space.  The tests are designed to make sure all the systems and components of Parker Solar Probe are operating as designed. This space environment testing will continue for about seven weeks.  Parker Solar Probe will emerge from the vacuum chamber in mid-March for final tests before setting off for Florida, where it will launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on July 31, 2018. ",
